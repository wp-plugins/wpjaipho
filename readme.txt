WPJaipho extends native Wordpress image gallery with optimized support for iPhone and iPad users

== Description ==

WpJaipho is a plugin which embeds Jaipho Javascript gallery into Wordpress. 

What does it do? 
For iPhone and iPad users, it replaces the Wordpress native media library image gallery (shortcode [gallery]) with Jaipho gallery template. Jaipho itself is an iPhone and iPad optimized javascript image gallery and it tends to look and behave like an native application. More info about Jaipho can be found at <a href="http://jaipho.com/" target="_blank">jaipho.com</a>

WPJaipho is tested with <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wptouch/" target="_blank">WPTouch</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mobile-pack/" target="_blank">WordPress Mobile Pack</a> and it was OK.
