WPJaipho extends native Wordpress image gallery, NextGEN 1.x and NextCellent Gallery with optimized support for mobile users

== Description ==

WPJaipho is plugin which adds mobile optimized look & feel to your WP based galleries.
It is based on the original <a href="http://jaipho.com/" target="_blank">Jaipho</a>, iPhone optimized Javascript gallery and it works on iPhone, iPad and Android devices.

= Supported WP galleries =
WP Jaipho works with: <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/" target="_blank">NextGEN 1.x</a> Gallery and Default WP Gallery (via Media Library). It also works flawlessly with some mobile theme plugins such as <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wptouch/" target="_blank">WPTouch</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mobile-pack/" target="_blank">WordPress Mobile Pack</a>.

= How Does it Work? =
Simple enough - just activate the plugin, and all your galleries are automatically transformed into mobile optimized gallery, which is visible for mobile users only. Check out demo <a href="http://www.viberfaq.com/viber-android-beta-version-review/" target="_blank">here</a> with your iPhone.

= Demo =

== Installation ==

2. Activate WPJaipho after the installation.
